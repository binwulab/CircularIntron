To run the Matlab scripts, you need to install Matlab (MathWorks). 
We recommend installing latest version, as the scripts were run on R2018a versions.

To run scripts open them in Matlab, change the directory of the fasta files to yours. 
The run of full data set can take up to several hours depending on the compututational power of your set up.
Run the DEMO files to check if your settings are correct. They are set up to run a subset of the data (~5%), making it much faster to run. 
Each of the scripts has a short instruction on how to run it.
